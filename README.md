Calendar
====

Features
----

Simple calendar that shows Japanese holidays. The calendar also provides function to mark dates.

This should work offline by application cache, but it requires network access to get holidays from Google Calendar API at the first time.

All holiday data and marked date(s) are stored in local storage.

This calenadr supports iOS. It might work properly on Android 4.0 (though I haven't confirmed yet.) This doen't work on Android 2.x because the android web browser doesn't support CSS3 anmiation very well.
